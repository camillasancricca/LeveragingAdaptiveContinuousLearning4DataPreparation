# Leveraging Adaptive and Continuous Learning to Enhance Data Preparation Pipelines

This work implements a recommender system based on continuous learning that exploits past users’ actions and empirical knowledge. The system provides context-aware and adaptive recommendations tailored to the user’s capabilities and needs regarding the optimal preparation tasks for the user’s analysis scenario. Employing the empirical results of previously collected experiments, we proved that our approach provides reliable recommendations and outperforms existing recommender system strategies. Note that, in this work, we focused on a single data preparation technique: data imputation.
